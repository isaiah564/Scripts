Array Methods

map()
The map() method creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. It is useful for transforming data.

filter()
The filter() method generates a new array containing elements that pass a specified test. This is helpful for filtering out unwanted data.

Classes

Basic Class Definition
Classes in ES6 provide a clearer and more concise way to create objects and handle inheritance compared to traditional constructor functions.

Inheritance
ES6 classes allow for easy inheritance, enabling a subclass to inherit properties and methods from a parent class, promoting code reuse.

Destructuring

Nested Object Destructuring
Destructuring allows you to unpack values from nested objects, making it easier to access deeply nested properties.

Function Parameters Destructuring
Destructuring can be applied directly in function parameters, simplifying the syntax and making functions easier to read and use.

Variable Declarations

let
let allows you to declare block-scoped variables that can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope, providing better control over variable visibility.

const
const is used for variables that should not be reassigned. It promotes immutability while still allowing for the modification of object properties.

var
var declares variables that are function-scoped or globally scoped. It can be re-declared and updated, but its scope can lead to confusion in larger codebases.

Conclusion

These features introduced in ES6 enhance JavaScript's capabilities, making code more concise, readable, and maintainable. Explore the repository to see these features in action!
